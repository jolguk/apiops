2. Head back to the **Pull requests** section on your github repo. Review the changes, and once you're happy with them, complete the PR. If you head to the Actions section on our Gtihub repo you should now see the Run-Creator workflow triggered. Once the workflow run is successful head to your Azure portal to confirm that the APIM instance reflects your changes.
